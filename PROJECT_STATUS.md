# TikTok Fitness Content Analysis - Project Status

## Current Status: PAUSED
**Last Updated:** August 4, 2025  
**Next Session Priority:** Continue exploratory data analysis by category

---

## üéØ WHERE WE LEFT OFF

### 1. Video Content Extraction Pipeline ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **8,351 videos processed** through content extraction pipeline
- **Success rate:** 12.4% full success (1,032 videos with both OCR and audio)
- **Audio transcription:** 736 videos (8.8%) have speech content
- **High-quality content:** 243 videos (2.9%) contain clear fitness instruction
- **Key finding:** Only ~9% of TikTok fitness videos contain spoken instruction

### 2. Content Quality Assessment ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Results Location:** `02_processed_data/extraction_results/`
- `video_content_analysis.csv` - Complete results (8,351 videos)
- `high_quality_fitness_content.csv` - Filtered quality content (243 videos)

**Key Insights:**
- Audio transcription >> OCR for TikTok content reliability
- Most TikTok fitness videos are music-driven with minimal spoken content
- Search terms with most instructional content: "workout finisher", "two day splits", "hybrid training"

### 3. Folder Structure Cleanup ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Reorganized from 15+ folders to clean 6-folder structure
- Clear data pipeline: `01_raw_data/` ‚Üí `02_processed_data/` ‚Üí `03_code/` ‚Üí `04_docs/`
- Main entry point: `run_pipeline.py`

## üîÑ CURRENT WORK IN PROGRESS

### A. Exploratory Data Analysis by Category 
**STATUS: IN PROGRESS - NEEDS CONTINUATION**

**What we were doing:**
- Analyzing performance patterns across different fitness categories
- Investigating engagement rate distributions within search terms
- Validating statistical significance of category differences
- Looking for outliers and creator influence patterns

**Files to continue with:**
- `02_processed_data/exports/` - Contains 14 analysis CSVs ready for exploration
- `03_code/analysis/explore_engagement_distribution.py` - EDA script
- Need to run rigorous category-by-category analysis

### B. Audio Transcription & OCR Assessment
**STATUS: PARTIALLY COMPLETE - NEEDS FOLLOW-UP**

**What we completed:**
- Fixed major audio transcription bug (NoneType errors)
- Successfully processed all 8,351 videos
- Identified that 8.8% have meaningful audio content
- Found that OCR is challenging due to TikTok's stylized text

**What needs follow-up:**
- Potential OCR improvements using cloud services (Google Vision, AWS Textract)
- Analysis of the 243 high-quality videos for content patterns
- Evaluation of whether current extraction quality is sufficient for business insights

## üéØ NEXT STEPS WHEN RESUMING

### Immediate Priority (1-2 days)
1. **Continue EDA by Category**
   - Run `03_code/analysis/explore_engagement_distribution.py`
   - Analyze the 14 CSV exports in `02_processed_data/exports/`
   - Validate statistical significance of category performance differences
   - Document findings with confidence intervals

2. **Complete Content Extraction Assessment**
   - Analyze the 243 high-quality videos for business insights
   - Determine if current extraction quality meets analysis needs
   - Document recommendations for potential improvements

### Medium Priority (3-5 days)
3. **Generate Validated Insights Report**
   - Create statistically rigorous TikTok Intelligence Report
   - Include confidence intervals and bias documentation
   - Provide actionable business recommendations

4. **Create Analysis Tools**
   - Interactive tools for team to explore data
   - Methodology transparency documentation

## üîß TECHNICAL CONTEXT

### Pipeline Status
- Video content extraction pipeline is fully functional
- Audio transcription working (8.8% success rate expected for TikTok content)
- OCR producing some results but limited by TikTok's stylized text
- All 4,445 videos downloaded and processed

### Analysis Context
- Initial CSV exports completed but need rigorous statistical validation
- Phase 1 report draft exists but requires deeper analysis
- Need to distinguish between creator influence and category performance
- Sample sizes vary significantly between categories
