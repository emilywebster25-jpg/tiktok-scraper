## Granular Search Term Analysis Rules

### **Structure:**
1. **Specific Workout Types** (or "Specific Qualities" if analyzing a modality)
2. **Messaging Approaches** 
3. **Strategic Insights for Centr**

### **Data Requirements:**
- Analyze top 10 highest-engagement videos for each search term
- Read full captions and hashtags, don't make assumptions
- Categorize based on actual content, not surface-level keywords

### **Metrics Format:**
- **Category Name**: X videos, Y% avg engagement
- No editorializing words like "dominates," "leads," etc.
- Just clean metrics

### **Content Analysis:**
- Focus on actual delivery approaches and themes within videos
- Group similar messaging approaches with quantifiable backing
- Include key attributes (like beginner-friendly) with supporting metrics
- No meaningless categories like "unspecified/general"

### **Strategic Insights:**
- Must be deeper than surface observations
- Focus on what Centr can actually learn and apply
- Avoid obvious statements (like "women-targeted content works for women")

### **Discussion After Each:**
- Stop after each analysis for feedback on method, structure, and insights
- Refine approach based on feedback before proceeding
