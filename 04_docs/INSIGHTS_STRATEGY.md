## Executive Summary

This document analyzes TikTok fitness content performance patterns to understand how different workout modalities perform and how creators communicate fitness. These insights inform Centr's approach to program naming, social media strategy, talent selection, and content creation.


## How This Analysis Was Done

This analysis scraped TikTok fitness content in order to inform Centr's program creative, social media strategy, talent research, and content approach by analyzing fitness content performance and understanding how creators communicate different workout modalities.

- **Data Collection**: 4,183 high-quality TikTok fitness videos using Apify's TikTok scraper from July 30-August 1, 2025
- **Search Coverage**: 98 different search terms (like "dumbbell cardio women", "hybrid training", "pilates workout") 
- **Creator Coverage**: 3,064 unique creators analyzed
- **Metrics Gathered**: Engagement data (likes, comments, shares, views) and calculated engagement rates for each video
- **Categorization**: Similar search terms grouped into categories (like grouping "dumbbell cardio men" and "kettlebell cardio women" into a "Cardio" category)
- **Analysis**: Average performance calculated for each category to show what types of fitness content typically perform well or poorly on TikTok

**What the numbers mean:**
- **Engagement Rate** = (Likes + Comments + Shares) ÷ Views × 100
- **Success Rate** = Percentage of videos in that category that hit >10% engagement
- **Average Views** = Typical reach for that type of content

The categories are organized by performance level and labeled with confidence indicators based on how much data we have for each category.

## Data Confidence Labels

Categories are labeled based on sample size to indicate how much we can trust the findings:
- **High Confidence**: 500+ videos (very trustworthy)
- **Reliable**: 100-500 videos (trustworthy)  
- **Limited Data**: <100 videos (use with caution)
- **Exploratory**: <50 videos (needs more data)

## Strategic Implications for Centr

### Performance Measurement:
- **Use category-relative benchmarks** rather than absolute targets
- **Account for content age** when measuring performance
- **Focus on consistency trends** rather than individual video success rates

## Ongoing Analysis

### Discussion Log:
*Key insights and corrections from collaborative analysis*

**August 3, 2025**:
- **"Failed" content insight**: Low engagement isn't failure - often reflects content recency
- **Temporal analysis feedback**: Focus on overall patterns, not time-based comparisons
- **Small sample size correction**: Creator percentages meaningless with <10 videos
- **Strategy vs landscape clarification**: Provide performance context, not content priorities
- **Market saturation assumption error**: Video counts reflect search strategy, not market saturation
- **Yoga/Pilates grouping error**: "Yoga/Pilates" category was actually just Pilates content (87 videos) - no dedicated yoga search terms in dataset
- **"General Fitness" category error**: Artificial grouping of unrelated search terms ("plyometric workout", "hyrox program", "couch to 5k", etc.) - needs individual analysis
- **Recovery/Mobility categorization error**: Initially only included "recovery workout" (43 videos) when there were 7 related search terms (294 total videos) - corrected to show full category with performance range
- **Cardio/running misclassification**: Initially labeled running/walking terms as "cardio" when they're distinct categories
- **Multiple category restriction error**: Incorrectly removed cardio terms from gender categories when search terms can belong to multiple categories simultaneously

### Next Exploration Areas:
- [ ] **PRIORITY: Granular category analysis** - Deep dive into specific search terms within each category to identify nuanced performance patterns
- [ ] Search query performance patterns
- [ ] Hashtag effectiveness analysis
- [ ] Creator follower tier performance
- [ ] Content format optimization insights

### Explored Hypotheses:
- **Gender targeting hypothesis** (Aug 3, 2025): Women-targeted content outperforms men-targeted (6.28% vs 5.30%), but evidence is mixed on whether this is due to women seeking gender-specific content vs men defaulting to "neutral" content. Creator quality and general engagement patterns may be larger factors.

### Archived Analysis Notes:

**Creator Performance Intelligence:**
- Small sample sizes (<10 videos) are unreliable for assessing creator consistency
- Even established creators have low success rates - @maiahenryfit: 12% high-performance rate across 26 videos
- >10% engagement is exceptional - even top creators achieve this rarely

**Content Performance Factors:**
- 2.5% of content has <1% engagement - includes both genuinely poor content and recent content that hasn't accumulated engagement
- Apify's scraping methodology captures both historical top performers and current trending content
- Recency bias exists - newer content appears to underperform simply because it's newer
- Recent content (last 6 months): 2,415 videos, 6.41% avg engagement
- Established content (>6 months old): 1,768 videos, 5.06% avg engagement
- Key insight: Time allows engagement accumulation - control for recency when analyzing performance
