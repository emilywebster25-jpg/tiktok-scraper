# TikTok Download Session Summary - August 2, 2025

## Session Overview
Continued from previous session to complete TikTok video downloads before Apify subscription expires.

## Starting Point
- **Videos at start**: 1,997
- **Disk space**: 317GB available
- **Issue identified**: Script stuck re-downloading duplicates from multiple timestamp versions

## Key Actions Taken

### 1. Fixed Duplicate Processing Issue
- Modified `download_videos.py` to only process latest version of each dataset
- Added early return when video exists to skip all supplementary downloads
- Reduced processing time from O(n*m) to O(n)

### 2. Set Up Overnight Pipeline
- Created `overnight_download.sh` for automated 3-phase processing:
  - Phase 1: Complete existing video assessment
  - Phase 2: Download new Apify datasets
  - Phase 3: Process all videos seamlessly
- Disabled sleep mode (attempted, but only worked for plugged-in mode)
- Created recovery documentation (`OVERNIGHT_STATUS.md`)

### 3. Managed Sleep Interruption
- Computer went to sleep at 8:20 AM (battery mode sleep settings)
- Processes resumed when computer woke up
- Used `caffeinate -d` to prevent further sleep interruptions
- Pipeline continued and completed successfully

## Final Results
- **Total videos**: 4,445 (up from 1,997)
- **Videos added**: 2,448 (122% increase)
- **Storage used**: 28.8GB total
