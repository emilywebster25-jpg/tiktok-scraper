# üåô Overnight TikTok Download Status & Recovery Guide

## What Was Planned (August 1-2, 2025)

### The 3-Phase Pipeline
‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Complete existing video assessment (50 datasets, 1,997+ videos)
‚è≥ **Phase 2**: Download new Apify datasets (user added more TikTok scraper runs)
‚è≥ **Phase 3**: Process all videos seamlessly (skip existing, download new)

### Scripts Running
- **Current process**: `download_videos.py` (checking existing videos)
- **Overnight pipeline**: `overnight_download.sh` (waiting to start Phase 2)
- **Sleep mode**: DISABLED via `sudo pmset -c sleep 0`

## Current Status (as of 12:50 AM)
- **Phase 1**: Still running, processing "hyrox doubles training plan" (video 53/60)
- **Video count**: 1,997 videos already downloaded
- **Battery**: 9 hours remaining when started
- **Pipeline**: Automatically monitoring and waiting

## What Should Happen Overnight

### If Everything Works:
1. Phase 1 completes (~10 mins remaining)
2. `download_apify_data.py` runs automatically (downloads new datasets)
3. `download_videos.py` restarts and processes all datasets
4. Final result: Complete video collection from old + new searches

### Log Files to Check:
- `overnight_pipeline.log` - Main pipeline status
- `overnight_log.txt` - Detailed download logs
- `video_download_fast.log` - Current video processing

## Recovery Instructions (If System Reset)

### Check What Completed:
```bash
cd "/Users/emilywebster/Dev/Entry tasks/tiktok_scrape"

# Check final video count
find videos/ -name "*.mp4" | wc -l

# Check if new datasets were downloaded
ls -la apify_downloads/ | grep "$(date +%Y%m%d)" | wc -l

# Review what happened
tail -50 overnight_pipeline.log
```

### If Pipeline Was Interrupted:
1. **Check battery status**: `pmset -g batt`
2. **Resume from where it stopped**:
   - If Phase 1 incomplete: `python3 download_videos.py`
   - If Phase 2 needed: `python3 download_apify_data.py`
   - If Phase 3 needed: `python3 download_videos.py` (will process all)

### Tell Claude:
*"My TikTok download pipeline was running overnight but got interrupted. The OVERNIGHT_STATUS.md file shows what was planned. Can you help me check what completed and resume from where it left off?"*

## Expected Final Results
- **Original datasets**: 50 unique search queries
- **New datasets**: Additional searches from recent Apify runs
- **Total videos**: 2,415+ from original + unknown number from new searches
- **Storage used**: 15-30GB estimated
- **File organization**: videos/, covers/, music/ folders with search-query naming

## Key Technical Details
- **Duplicate handling**: Script skips existing videos automatically
- **API integration**: Uses stored Apify API key for downloads
- **Error handling**: Continues processing even if some downloads fail
- **Efficient processing**: Only checks video existence, skips everything else for existing files
