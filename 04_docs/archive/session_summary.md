# Session Summary - TikTok Dataset Analysis

**Date:** August 1, 2025  
**Task:** Analyze TikTok datasets to identify valid files vs duplicates

## Current Status
- **Started:** Analysis of 163 TikTok JSON files in apify_downloads directory
- **Plan Created:** Comprehensive 4-step analysis plan in todo.md
- **Next Step:** Begin file inventory and categorization

## Key Findings So Far
- 163 total TikTok JSON files found
- Multiple timestamp patterns suggest 3+ scraping sessions
- Files follow pattern: `tiktok_{search_query}_{timestamp}.json`
- Several "unknown" files present (need investigation)

## Immediate Objectives
1. Get accurate count excluding unknown files
2. Extract and categorize unique search queries  
3. Identify most recent/complete version of each dataset
4. Provide clear recommendations for video downloads

## User Context
- User expects ~57 unique queries with 40-60 videos each
- Need accurate download progress estimate
- Must distinguish valid datasets from failed/duplicate runs
