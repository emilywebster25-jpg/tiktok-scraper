# TikTok Video Content Extraction Pipeline - Session Summary

## Session Progress

### Problem Identified
- Initial pipeline run processed 4,444 videos but only achieved 0.8% readable content
- 99% of videos failed audio transcription with "NoneType object is not subscriptable" error
- OCR was working (73% of videos) but producing mostly garbled text due to TikTok's stylized overlays

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Audio Transcription Failure**: Whisper's word_timestamps feature was returning None instead of empty lists, causing the NoneType error
2. **OCR Quality Issues**: TikTok's stylized text with effects, shadows, and complex backgrounds makes traditional OCR challenging

### Solutions Implemented
1. **Initial Fix Attempt**: Added None checks in audio_transcriber.py (partial fix)
2. **Complete Rewrite**: Created robust audio transcriber with:
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Disabled word_timestamps to avoid Whisper issues
   - Simplified transcription approach
   - Better error reporting

### Current Status
- Pipeline is running in background processing all 4,445 videos
- Fixed audio transcription is now working successfully
- Already processed 500 videos with the new system
- Expected completion time: 8-10 hours

### Results So Far
- OCR: Extracting some text but mostly single characters due to TikTok styling
- Audio: Now successfully transcribing speech when present
- Many videos likely contain only music (no speech to transcribe)

### Next Steps
1. Let pipeline complete overnight
2. Analyze final results to determine:
   - What percentage of videos contain actual speech vs just music
   - Quality of transcriptions for videos with speech
   - Whether OCR improvements are needed or if audio alone is sufficient
3. Consider post-processing to clean up results

## Key Learnings
- TikTok videos present unique challenges for content extraction
- Audio transcription is more reliable than OCR for fitness content
- Robust error handling is critical when processing thousands of files
- Many TikTok fitness videos may be music-only with minimal spoken content
